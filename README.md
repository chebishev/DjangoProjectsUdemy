9 projects from the "Django Masterclass" course

In order of appearance:

1. Web Based CV Generator opens a form that the user fills with data and returns (directly downloads) a pdf file with the result
- it needs wkhtmltopdf on your device in order the conversion to work (https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf)

2. Web Based Site Scraper that searches for link in format https://www.example.com and returns all valid links
- scraping is done via requests and beautiful soup
- all results are clickable and lead to a new tab with the results
- the "delete" button clears all records from the db
- bootstrap is used for the "design"
- custom form is used for the search bar in order to show appropriate errors in case of ivalid input
